<p>Welcome to homepage of WHDD project.<br />
WHDD is a HDD diagnostic and data recovery tool for Linux.<br />
It is capable of testing a hard drive with reading and writing, providing intuitive visualization of the process. Visualization or these tests is very similar to MHDD.<br />
Amongst others, there is a function for copying the device. The copying procedure algorithms are optimized for least harm to already-defective source device. The meaning of this becomes clear in a <a title="Demo" href="http://whdd.org/?page_id=57">demo</a>.<br />
WHDD may work with your hard drives on low level, sending ATA commands to device, the benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>no system freeze while accessing damaged device (device is soft-reset on timeout);</li>
<li>better timing precision.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're happy to bring such a good tool for you, but note that <strong>there's no warranty! You're on your own!</strong><br />
<strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
