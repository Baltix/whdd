<p>Changes since 2.1:<br />
* Fix problems with small displays like 80x25<br />
* Fix ATA compliance recognition (see <a href="https://github.com/krieger-od/whdd/issues/57">bug #57</a>)<br />
* Replace "Press any key" with "Press 'm' for menu"<br />
* Rework signal handling during procedure for stability<br />
* Improve build system</p>
<p>Sorry, but WHDD still doesn't compile on stock Ubuntu 14 (except you use ./build_static.sh), because Ubuntu contains way too old `dialog` package - the one from 2011! What a shame.</p>
